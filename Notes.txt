My template making doesn't produce the perfect templates. It disallows more combinations than needed.
For example., with the Andromeda chain, my template requires (5,0) and (2,2) to be different, but the
supplied chain to get the template has both of those as the same colour. This is because my method
find groups of puyo that pop together and labels them with unique capital letters. The group of yellows
at the beginning actually split up and pop in separate groups, so they consist of different capital letters
and my relationship matrix makes capital letters that are adjacent at any point in the chain different colours
to each other (in case that they accidentally pop) and this is probably too cautious. This means that those 2 coordinates
have to be different colours even though they don't have to be.

I made TMS look for the node that has the highest accordance score, rather than just the depth-3 nodes.
This will result in a more greedy algorithm that looks for more early payoffs. It may not be a good change, however
it ensures that the chain gets finished if it is nearing the finish. And then switches to PMS.
