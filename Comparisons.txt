PMS4 vs Human:
    PMS4: 3 (lost due to setting an 8-chain off early and they countered with a 10-Chain and lost.
    Human: 7 (Seems to have some weaknesses that can be exploited. Waiting until they set off a chain to then outdo
    or waiting until they mess up the trigger seems to be the best strategy. Harassment seems to not be as effective
    as it can be countered easily with same size chain.)
